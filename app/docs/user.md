# CompareExpressions

This function utilises the [`SymPy`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html) to provide a maths-aware comparison of a student's response to the correct answer. This means that mathematically equivalent inputs will be marked as correct. Note that `pi` is a reserved constant and cannot be used as a symbol name.

Note that this function is designed to handle comparisons of mathematical expressions but has some limited ability to handle comparison of equalities as well. More precisely, if the answer is of the form $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and the response is of the form $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ then the function checks if $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) - g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a multiple of $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) / \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

## Inputs

### Optional parameters

There are 15 optional parameters that can be set: `atol`, `complexNumbers`, `convention`, `criteria`, `elementary_functions`, `feedback_for_incorrect_response`, `multiple_answers_criteria`, `physical_quantity`, `plus_minus`/`minus_plus`, `rtol`, `specialFunctions`, `strict_syntax`, `strictness`, `symbol_assumptions`.

#### `atol`
Sets the absolute tolerance, $e_a$, i.e. if the answer, $x$, and response, $\tilde{x}$, are numerical values then the response is considered equal to the answer if $|x-\tilde{x}| \leq e_aBy default `atol` is set to `0`, which means the comparison will be done with as high accuracy as possible. If either the answer or the response aren't numerical expressions this parameter is ignored.

#### `complexNumbers`

If you want to use `I` for the imaginary constant, set the grading parameter `complexNumbers` to True.

#### `convention`

Changes the implicit multiplication convention. If unset it will default to `equal_precedence`.

If set to `implicit_higher_precedence` then implicit multiplication will have higher precedence than explicit multiplication, i.e. `1/ab` will be equal to `1/(ab)` and `1/a*b` will be equal to `(1/a)*b`.

If set to `equal_precedence` then implicit multiplication will have the same precedence than explicit multiplication, i.e. both `1/ab` and `1/a*b` will be equal to `(1/a)*b`.

#### `criteria`

The `criteria` parameter can be used to customize the comparison performed by the evaluation function. If unset the evaluation function will will default to checking if the answer and response are symbolically equal.

The `criteria` parameter takes a string that defines a set of (comma separated) mathematical statements. If all statements in the list are true the response is considered correct.

The `criteria` parameter reserves `response` and `answer` as keywords that will be replaced y the response and answer respectively when the criteria is checked. Setting `criteria` to `answer=response` is gives the same behaviour as leaving `criteria` unset.

**Note:** Currently the `criteria` parameter is ignored if `physical_quantity` is set to true.

##### Available criteria

**Note:** In the table below EXPRESSION is used to denote some mathematical expression, i.e. a string that contains mathematical symbols and operators, but no equal signs `=` or inequality signs `>`, '<'.

| Name  | Syntax                         | Description                         | Example             |
|-------|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------|:--------------------|
| EQUAL | `EXPRESSION = EXPRESSION`      | Checks if the expressions are equal | `answer = response` - Default way to check equality of expressions |
| ORDER | `EXPRESSION ORDER EXPRESSION`  | Checks if the expressions have the given order. ORDER operators can be `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | `answer > response` - Checks if the answer is greater than the response |
| WHERE | `EXPRESSION = EXPRESSION where EXPRESSION = EXPRESSION; ... ; EXPRESSION = EXPRESSION` | Checks if the equality on the left side of `where` are equal if the equalities in the comma-separated list on the right side of `where` | `answer = response where x = 0` - Checks if the curves given by the answer and the response intersect when $x=0$. |
| WRITTEN_AS | `EXPRESSION written as EXPRESSION` | Syntactical comparison, checks if the two expressions are written the same way. | `response written as answer` - Checks if the response is written in the same for as the answer (e.g. if answer is `(x+1)(x+2)` then the response `x^2+3x+2` will not satisfy the criteria but `(x+3)(x+4)` will). |
| PROPORTIONAL | `EXPRESSION proportional to EXPRESSION` | Checks if one expression can be written is equivalent to the other expression multiplied by some constant. | `answer proportional to response` |
| CONTAINS | `EXPRESSION contains EXPRESSION` | Checks if the left expression has the right expression as a subexpression. | `response contains x` - Checks if the response contains the symbol x |


#### `elementary_functions`

When using implicit multiplication function names with multiple characters are sometimes split and not interpreted properly. Setting `elementary_functions` to true will reserve the function names listed below and prevent them from being split. If a name is said to have one or more alternatives this means that it will accept the alternative names but the reserved name is what will be shown in the preview.

`sin`, `sinc`, `csc` (alternative `cosec`), `cos`, `sec`, `tan`, `cot` (alternative `cotan`), `asin` (alternative `arcsin`), `acsc` (alternatives `arccsc`, `arccosec`), `acos` (alternative `arccos`), `asec` (alternative `arcsec`), `atan` (alternative `arctan`), `acot` (alternatives `arccot`, `arccotan`), `atan2` (alternative `arctan2`), `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `csch` (alternative `cosech`), `sech`, `asinh` (alternative `arcsinh`), `acosh` (alternative `arccosh`), `atanh` (alternative `arctanh`), `acsch` (alternatives `arccsch`, `arcosech`), `asech` (alternative `arcsech`), `exp` (alternative `Exp`), `E` (equivalent to `exp(1)`, alternative `e`), `log`, `sqrt`, `sign`, `Abs` (alternative `abs`), `Max` (alternative `max`), `Min` (alternative `min`), `arg`, `ceiling` (alternative `ceil`), `floor`

#### `feedback_for_incorrect_response`
All feedback for all incorrect responses will be replaced with the string that this parameter is set to.

#### `multiple_answers_criteria`

The $\pm$ and $\mp$ symbols can be represented in  the answer or response by `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` respectively.

Answers or responses that contain $\pm$ or $\mp$ has two possible interpretations which requires further criteria for equality. The grading parameter `multiple_answers_criteria` controls this. The default setting, `all`, is that each answer must have a corresponding answer and vice versa. The setting `all_responses` check that all responses are valid answers and the setting `all_answers` checks that all answers are found among the responses.

#### `physical_quantity`

If unset, `physical_quantity` will default to `false`. 

If `physical_quantity` is set to `true` the answer and response will interpreted as a physical quantity using units and conventions decided by the `strictness` and `units_string` parameters.

**Remark:** Setting `physical_quantity` to `true` will also mean that comparisons will be done numerically. If neither the `atol` nor `rtol` parameters are set, the evaluation function will choose a relative error based on the number of significant digits given in the answer.


When `physical_quantity` the evaluation function will generate feedback based on the flowchart below.

**TODO:** Generate new flowchart for updated physical quantity feedback generation procedure.

#### `rtol`
Sets the relative tolerance, $e_r$, i.e. if the answer, $x$, and response, $\tilde{x}$, are numerical values then the response is considered equal to the answer if $\left|\frac{x-\tilde{x}}{x}\right| \leq e_r$. By default `rtol` is set to `0`, which means the comparison will be done with as high accuracy as possible. If either the answer or the response aren't numerical expressions this parameter is ignored.

#### `strictness`

Controls the conventions used when parsing physical quantities.

**Remark:** If `physical_quantity` is set to `false`, this parameter will be ignored. 

There are three possible values: `strict`, `natural` and `legacy`. If `strict` is chosen then quantities will be parsed according to the conventions described in 5.1, 5.2, 5.3.2, 5.3.3 in [The International System of Units (SI), 8th edition](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/si_brochure_8.pdf) and 5.2, 5.3, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 in [The International System of Units (SI), 9th edition](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf). If `natural` is chosen then less restrictive conventions are used.

**Remark:** The default setting is `natural`.

**Remark:** The `legacy` setting should not be used and is only there to allow compatibility with content designed for use with older versions of the evaluation function. If you encounter a question using the `legacy` setting is recommended that it is changed to another setting and the answer is redefined to match the chosen conventions.

#### `units_string`

Controls what sets of units are used. There are three values `SI`, `common` and `imperial`.

If `SI` is chosen then only units from the tables `Base SI units` and `Derived SI units` (below) are allowed (in combinations with prefixes). If `common` is chosen then all the units allowed by `SI` as well as those listed in the tables for `Common non-SI units`. If `imperial` is chosen the base SI units and the units listed in the `Imperial units` table are allowed.

**Remark:** The different settings can also be combined, e.g. `SI common imperial` will allow all units.

The default setting is to allow all units, i.e. `units_string` is set to `SI common imperial`.

#### `plus_minus` and `minus_plus`

The $\pm$ and $\mp$ symbols can be represented in  the answer or response by `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` respectively.

To use other symbols for $\pm$ and $\mp$ set the grading parameters `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` to the desired symbol. **Remark:** symbol replacement is brittle and can have unintended consequences.

#### `specialFunctions`

If you want to use the special functions `beta` (Euler Beta function), `gamma` (Gamma function) and `zeta` (Riemann Zeta function), set the grading parameter `specialFunctions` to True.

#### `strict_syntax`

If `strict_syntax` is set to true then the answer and response must have `*` or `/` between each part of the expressions and exponentiation must be done using `**`, e.g. `10*x*y/z**2` is accepted but `10xy/z^2` is not.

If `strict_syntax` is set to false, then `*` can be omitted and `^` used instead of `**`. In this case it is also recommended to list any multicharacter symbols expected to appear in the response as input symbols.

By default `strict_syntax` is set to true.

#### `symbol_assumptions`

This input parameter allows the author to set an extra assumption each symbol. Each assumption should be written on the form `('symbol','assumption name')` and all pairs concatenated into a single string.

The possible assumptions are: `constant`, `function` as well as those listed here: 
[SymPy Assumption Predicates](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/guides/assumptions.html#predicates)

**Note:** Writing a symbol which denotes a function without its arguments, e.g. `T` instead of `T(x,t)`, is prone to cause errors.

### Examples

Implemented versions of these examples can be found in the module 'Examples: Evaluation Functions'.

#### Setting input symbols to be assumed positive to avoid issues with fractional powers

In general $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} \neq \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ but if $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ then $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$. The same is true for other fractional powers.

So if expressions like these are expected in the answer and/or response then it is a good idea to use the `symbol_assumptions` parameter to note that $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. This can be done by setting `symbol_assumptions` to `('a','positive') ('b','positive')`.

The example given in the example problem set uses two EXPRESSION response areas. Both response areas uses `compareExpression` with answer `sqrt(a/b)`, as well as `strict_syntax` set to false and `elementary_functions` set to true.

The first response area leaves `symbol_assumptions` unset. Since $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$ is only guaranteed to be true if both $a$ and $b$ are positive. The response area does not inform the evaluation function that it should assume that $a$ and $b$ are positive, thus it will not consider `sqrt(a)/sqrt(b)` $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$ equivalent to the answer given by the teacher.

The second response area sets `symbol_assumptions` to `('a','positive') ('b','positive')`. Some examples of expressions that are now accepted as correct with $a$ and $b$ assumed to be positive:
`sqrt(a)/sqrt(b)` $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$, `(a/b)^(1/2)` $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, `a^(1/2)/b^(1/2)` $\frac{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}{b^{\frac{1}{2}}}$, `(a/b)^(0.5)` $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{0.5}$, `a^(0.5)/b^(0.5)` $\frac{a^{0.5}}{b^{0.5}}$.

#### Using plus/minus symbols

The $\pm$ and $\mp$ symbols can be represented in the answer or response by `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` respectively. To use other symbols for $\pm$ and $\mp$ set the parameters `plus_minus` and `minus_plus` to the desired symbol. 

**Note:** symbol replacement is brittle and can have unintended consequences.

It is considered good practice to make sure that the appropriate notation for $\pm$ and $\mp$ are added and displayed as input symbols in order to minimize confusion.

The example given in the example problem set uses an EXPRESSION response area that uses `compareExpression` with answer `plus_minus x^2 + minus_plus y^2` $\pm x^2 + (\mp y^2)$, `strict_syntax` set to false and `elementary_function` set to true. Some examples of expressions that are accepted as correct:
`plus_minus x^2 + minus_plus y^2` $\pm x^2 + (\mp y^2)$, `- minus_plus x^2 + minus_plus y^2` $-\pm x^2 + (\mp y^2)$, `plus_minus x^2 minus_plus y^2` $\pm x^2 \mp y^2$, `- minus_plus x^2 - plus_minus y^2` $-\mp x^2 - \pm y^2$.

#### Equalities in the answer and response

There is (limited) support for using equalities in the response and answer. More precisely, if the answer is of the form $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and the response is of the form $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ then the function checks if $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) - g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a multiple of $\tilde{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) / \tilde{g}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

The example given in the example problem set uses an EXPRESSION response area that uses `compareExpression` with answer `x^2-5\*y^2-7=0` $x^2-5y^2-7=0$ as well as `strict_syntax` set to false and `elementary_functions` set to true. Any equality of the form $f(x) = g(x)$ such that $f(x)-g(x) = k \cdot (x^2-5y^2-7)$ where $k$ is a non-zero constant should be accepted.

Some examples of expressions that are accepted as correct:
`x^2-5\*y^2-7=0` $x^2-5y^2-7=0$, `x^2 = 5y^2+7` $x^2=5y^2+7$, `2x^2 = 10y^2+14` $2x^2=10y^2+14=0$.

#### Checking the value of an expression or a physical quantity

If the parameter `physical_quantity` is set to true, the evaluation function can handle expressions that describe physical quantities. Which units are permitted and how they should be written depends on the `units_string` and `strictness` parameters respectively.

There are three examples in the example problem set. Each examples uses an EXPRESSION response area that uses `compareExpression` with answer `strict_syntax` set to false and `physical_quantity` set to true.

##### Example (a)

The response area below has answer `2.00 km/h` $2.00 \frac{\mathrm{kilometre}}{\mathrm{hour}}$ .

There are many possible correct responses, e.g. `2.00 kilometre/hour`, `2 km/h`, `2000 m/h`, `0.556 meter/second`, `2 metre/millihour`.

Note that the answer is given with 2 correct decimals, so responses such as `1.996 km/h` and `2.004 km/h` are also accepted.

If responding in other units the evaluation function by default assumes that the same relative error is acceptable so `0.556 m/s` is considered correct but `0.56 m/s` is not.

##### Example (b)

Here the answer is `2.00 km/h`. To restrict the answers to SI units `strictness` is set to `strict` and `units_string` is set to `SI`. Some examples of accepted responses are: `0.556 metre/second`, `5.56 dm/s`, `55.6 centimetre second^(-1)`

##### Example (c)

Here the answer is `2.00 km/h`. To restrict the answers to imperial units `strictness` is set to `strict` and `units_string` is set to `imperial common`. Examples of accepted responses: `1.24 mile/hour`, `1.82 foot/second`

##### Example (d)

The values of physical quantities are always tested with some numerical tolerance, by default it is assumed that the the `answer` is given with the correct number of significant digit, e.g. `1 m` means 0.5 meter tolerance, while `1.0 m` means 0.05 metre tolerance.

The relative tolerance can also be set explicitly using the `rtol` parameter.

Here the answer is set to `1 N/cm`, while `physical_quantity` is set to `true` and `rtol` is set to `0.1` (i.e. a 10% relative error tolerance). It will accept any response between $0.9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{cm}}$ and $1.1 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{cm}}$.

#### Changing convention for precedence for implicit and explicit multiplication

You can change what convention is used for precedence for explicit and implicit multiplication by setting the `convention` parameter.

There are two supported conventions:

`equal_precedence` Implicit multiplication have the same precedence as explicit multiplication, i.e. both `1/ab` and `1/a*b` will be equal to `(1/a)*b`.

`implicit_higher_precedence` Implicit multiplication have higher precedence than explicit multiplication, i.e. `1/ab` will be equal to `1/(ab)` and `1/a*b` will be equal to `(1/a)*b`.

In the examples set there is one response area for each of the two conventions, both with answer `1/ab`. Try `1/ab`, `(1/a)*b` and `1/(a*b)` in both response areas and note the differences in behaviour.

#### Setting absolute or relative tolerances for numerical comparison

`compareExpressions` can be used both for symbolic and numerical comparisons. The default is symbolic comparisons.

The evaluation function can be configured to do numerical comparisons in the following ways:

- Setting the absolute error tolerance: This is done by setting the parameter `atol`. When `atol` is set to any positive value, then `response` will be considered correct if $|$`answer`$-$`response`$| < $`atol`.

- Setting the relative error tolerance: This is done by setting the parameter `rtol`. When `rtol` is set to any positive value, then `response` will be considered correct if $|$`answer`$-$`response`$|/|$`answer`$| < $`rtol`.

**Note:** If the response area is used to compare physical quantities (i.e. the parameter `physical_quantity` is set to `true`) comparisons will be numerical be default (since unit conversion has finite precision).

##### Setting the absolute tolerance

In the following response area the absolute tolerance (`atol`) has been set to $5$, `strict_syntax` is set to false and `elementary_function` is set to true.

The response area is set up with three correct answers: $\sqrt{47}+\pi$ (approx. 9.9997), $\frac{13}{3}^{\pi}$ (approx. 99.228) and $9^{e+\ln(1.5305)}$ (approx. 1000.05). Any answer within the set absolute tolerance (i.e. $5<$`response`$<15$, $95<$`response`$<105$ or $995<$`response`$<1005$) of any answer will be accepted.

##### Setting the relative tolerance

In the following response area the absolute tolerance (`atol`) has been set to $0.5$.

The response area is set up with three correct answers: $\sqrt{47}+\pi$ (approx. 9.9997), $\frac{13}{3}^{\pi}$ (approx. 99.228) and $9^{e+\ln(1.5305)}$ (approx. 1000.05). Any answer within the set absolute tolerance (i.e. $5<$`response`$<15$, $95<$`response`$<105$ or $995<$`response`$<1005$) of either answer will be considered correct.

#### Customizing comparisons using criteria

For a description of how criteria works, see section *Inputs: Optional parameters: `criteria`*.

For these examples all response areas will have `strict_syntax` set to false and `elementary_functions` set to true.

##### Default criteria - checking if two expressions are equal

If the `criteria` parameter is unset the evaluation function defaults to checking if the response is equal to the answer. It also attempts to recognise whether the input criteria is equivalent to checking if the response and answer are equal.

As an example the response area below has answer $5x$ and `criteria` set to `answer-response = 0, response/answer = 1` which are two different criteria equivalent to `response=answer` (assuming the answer is non-zero) so here the set criteria will not change the response area behaviour.

##### Using order operators instead of equality

Equality, $=$ (`=`), is not the only available comparison operator, criteria can also handle the typical order operators, $>$ (`>`), $<$ (`<`), $\leq$ (`>=`), $\geq$ (`<=`).

Here the answer is set to $2x^2$ and `criteria` is set to `answer <= response, 2\*answer > response`. Thus any response is greater than or equal to $2x^2$ but less than $2x^2+2$ will be accepted.

##### Criteria that analyses the response without comparing to the answer

This is an example of a question where the answer is not used in the comparison.

The response area accepts any root of the polynomial $x^3-6x^2+11x-6$.

This is achieved by setting the `criteria` parameter to `response^3-6*response^2+11*response-6=0`.

##### Using derivatives in criteria

Derivatives can be used in criteria, $\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}x}$ can be written as either `diff(f,x)` or `Derivative(f,x)`.

**Note:** To use abstract function (e.g. `f` is some arbitrary function that depends on `x`) or symbols that should be considered constant it is necessary to use the `function` and `constant` assumptions, see question "*Using the \`constant\` and `function` assumptions".*

Here `answer` is set to `sin(x)` and `criteria` is set to `diff(response,x)=answer`. Thus any expression in the form $c-\cos(x)$, where $c$ is a constant value will be considered correct.

**Note:** It will be assumed that any undefined symbol is a constant.

More complicated expressions can also be used in criteria, e.g. we can check if the response is a solution to a differential equation.

Suppose we want to check if the response is a solution to the logistic differential equation, $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\lambda y (1-y)$. In other words, any expression in the form $y(x) = \frac{c e^{\lambda x}}{1+c e^{\lambda x}}$ will be considered correct.

To get this behaviour, set `criteria` to `diff(response,x)=lambda*response*(1-response)`.

##### Using `where` to substitute symbols in criteria

One way to customize the comparison of two expressions is to substitute some symbol in the expression with either a specific number, or another symbol. This can be done using the `where` criteria.

The first response are will either accept $A \cos(\omega t)$ or $A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ as a correct answer. This is achieved by setting the answer to `A*cos(omega*t+phi)` and the  `criteria` parameter to `response=answer where phi=2*pi`.

To substitute a symbol with several different values, one criteria for each substitution must be created.

The second response area below will accept any function $f(x)$ whose curve passes through the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$. This is achieved by setting the answer to `x` and the `criteria` parameter to `response=answer where x=0, response=answer where x=1, response=answer where x=2`.

##### Using `contains` to check if response contains a certain symbol

To create a criteria that checks if an expressions contains a certain symbol we use `contains`.

Suppose we expect the response to be an expression that can be written in many equivalent (but not equal) ways, for example, if we ask for an expression that gives all numbers, $x$, such that $\sin(x)=0$, then $\pi n$ and $\pi+\pi n$ (where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$) are valid responses. Thus comparison with a reference expression is not enough. We can use the criteria `sin(response)=0` but this will only determine if the expression is an example of a number with the desired property, not a general expression. If we add another criteria, `response contains n`, we can also check that the response contains some dependence on an arbitrary integer.

The response area below has answer set to $0$, `criteria` set to `sin(response)=0, response contains n` and `symbol_assumptions` is set to `('n', integer)` (see *Setting input symbols to be assumed positive to avoid issues with fractional powers* and *Using the `constant` and `function` assumptions* for more information on how assumptions can be used). There is also an input symbol with code `N` and several alternatives that are commonly used to denote integers.

**Note:** There is currently a bug in the interaction between criteria and so only upper-case letters can be used for input symbols for this particular response area.

##### Using `proportional to` to check if the ratio between two expressions is constant

Criteria can be easily used to check if two expression differ by a certain factor, for example `response = 2*answer` checks if the response is twice the expected value. To check if two expressions differ with some arbitrary factor use `proportional to`.

In the response area below any (non-zero) multiple of $a+b+c$ will be accepted. It has `criteria` set to `response proportional to answer`.

##### Using `written as` to syntactical comparison

The evaluation function can automatically detect some patterns and do syntactical comparison (comparing if expressions are written in the same way instead of checking if they are mathematically equivalent) using the `syntactical_comparison` parameter. To check for more specific patterns the `written as` criteria can be used.

For example, one method to find the solutions to a quadratic equation is to *Complete the square*. Part of this method is to rewrite a second degree polynomial in the form $(x+p)^2+q$ where $p$ and $q$ are constants. This square form is not among the preprogrammed forms that the evaluation function is aware of, so if we want to make a response are where a student practices this rewrite step specifically it could be set up as the one below.

Suppose the task is to express $x^2-8x+11$ in the form $(x+p)^2+q$ where $p$ and $q$ are constants. The rewritten form in this case is $(x-4)^2-5$. In the response area below we have set the answer to `(x-4)^2-5` and `criteria` to `response = answer, response written as answer`. Thus `x^2-8x+11` will not be considered valid, but `(x-4)^2-5` will.

Note that the syntactical comparison done by `written as` is relatively crude, for example `-5+(x-4)^2` or `(x+(-4))^2+(-5)` will not be accepted. Some examples of how to improve this can be found in part (i).

##### Customising feedback based on satisfied criteria

The procedure for creating feedback on a student response can be briefly described as follows:

- Take student response and interpret it appropriately (exactly how depends on how various parameters are set)
- Analyse interpreted response and make a list of identified properties (what properties the evaluation function looks for depends on various parameters)
- For each identified property generate a string of text with appropriate feedback (note that in many cases, including the common case where the response is equal to the answer, this string will be empty)

When a property of the response is identified a corresponding tag is generated, and feedback strings are then generated for each string independently. The feedback for a particular tag can be overridden by the task author. **Note:** Since the possible set of tags depends on the several different parameters, it is not easy to know what parameters are available. Currently, the only method of finding out is for the task author to experiment using the test panel for a response area, where the tags can be seen as part of the *Raw test response* when a test fails.
If a response are uses some custom criteria then for each of those criteria the evaluation function can usually output (at least) three tags that consist if the string for the corresponding criterion with either `_TRUE`, `_FALSE` or `_UNKNOWN` appended, e.g. if `criteria` is , `diff(response) = answer, response contains x`, then the table below shows the possible tags:

| Criterion                 | Tags                                                                                                |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `diff(response) = answer` | `diff(response) = answer_TRUE`, `diff(response) = answer_FALSE`, `diff(response) = answer_UNKNOWN`  |
| `response contains x`     | `response contains x_TRUE`, `response contains x_FALSE`, `response contains x_UNKNOWN`              |

To change the feedback generated for a particular tag the `custom_feedback` parameter can be used. The parameter needs to be given a JSON object literal whose keys are tag strings and the values are feedback string.

As an example we can use the second response area from part (e). There the `criteria` parameter was set to `response=answer where x=0, response=answer where x=1, response=answer where x=2` creating a response area that accepts any function $f(x)$ whose curve passes through the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$.

For these criteria the table of tags looks like this:

| Criterion                   | Tags                                                                                                     |
|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `response=answer where x=0` | `response=answer where x=0_TRUE`, `response=answer where x=0_FALSE`, `response=answer where x=0_UNKNOWN` |
| `response=answer where x=1` | `response=answer where x=1_TRUE`, `response=answer where x=1_FALSE`, `response=answer where x=1_UNKNOWN` |
| `response=answer where x=2` | `response=answer where x=2_TRUE`, `response=answer where x=2_FALSE`, `response=answer where x=2_UNKNOWN` |

To set custom feedback for the cases where the graph misses any of the three points we can set the `custom_feedback` parameter as follows:

```javascript
{
 "response=answer where x=0_FALSE": "$f(x)$ gives the wrong value when $x=0$.",
 "response=answer where x=1_FALSE": "The curve does not pass through the point $(1,1)$.",
 "response=answer where x=2_FALSE": "Missed the third point.",
}
```

**Note:** The evaluation function can generate the tags (and the feedback strings) in any order, thus it is best practice to customise the feedback in such a way that the feedback for each tag can be read independently of the others.

**Note:** The following list of responses can be useful to see the the results of this particular feedback customisation:
$x$

$x^3-3x^2+3x$

$x^2-2x+2$

$x^2-x$

$x^2$

$0$

$1$

$2$

$3$

#### Using complex numbers

If the parameter `complexNumbers` is set to `true` then `I` will be interpreted as the imaginary constant $i$.

**Note:** When `i` is used to denote the imaginary constant, then it can end up forming reserved keywords when used with other symbols, e.g. `xi` will be interpreted as $\xi$ instead of $x \cdot i$. To see how to avoid this kind of issue, see [Working with Reserved Characters](#workiing-with-reserved-characters).

In this example, `complexNumbers` is set to `true` and the answer is `2+I`. An input symbols has also been added so that `I` can be replaced with `i` or `j`.

Any response that is mathematically equivalent $2+i$ to will be accepted, e.g. `2+I`, `2+(-1)^(1/2)`, `conjugate(2-I)`, `2sqrt(2)e^(I\*pi/4)+e^(I\*3\*pi/2)` or `re(2-I)-im(2-I)\*I`.

**Note:** If the particular way that the answer is written matter, e.g. only answers on cartesian form should be accepted, then that requires further configuration, see the example *Syntactical comparison*.

#### Using `constant` and `function` assumptions

Examples of how to use the `constant` and `function` assumptions for symbols.

#### Comparing equalities involving partial derivatives - Using the `constant` and `function` assumptions

The response should be some expression that is equivalent to this equation (i.e. `answer`): 

$$\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\dot{q}}{k}=\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$$

Here is an example of another valid response:

$$\alpha k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+ \alpha \dot{q} = k \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}$$

In general, if both the response and the answer are equalities, i.e. the response is $a=b$, and the answer is $c=d$, `compareExpressions` compares the answer and respose by checking if $\dfrac{a-b}{c-d}$ is a constant, i.e. it is assumed that $a-b$ and $c-d$ are not simplifyable to zero without assuming $a-b=c-d=0$.

By default `compareExpressions` assumes that symbols are independent of each other, a consequence of this is that derivatives will become zero, e.g. $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$. This can be prevented by assuming that some symbols are functions (a symbol assumed to be a function is assumed to depend on all other symbols). In this example we want to take derivatives of $T$ and $q$ so we add `('T','function') ('q','function')` to the `symbol_assumptions` parameter. 

Taking the ratio of the given answer and the example response gives:
$$ \frac{\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\dot{q}}{k} - \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}}{\alpha k \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}+ \alpha \dot{q} - k \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}} = \alpha k $$

By default $\alpha$ and $k$ are assumed to be variables so the ratio is not seen as a constant. This can be fixed by adding `('alpha','constant') ('k','constant')` to the `symbol_asssumptions` parameter.

The make it simpler and more intuitive to write valid responses we add the following input symbols:

| Symbol                                  | Code                    | Alternatives                |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| $\dot{q}$                               | `Derivative(q(x,t),t)`  | `q_{dot}, q_dot`            |
| $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t}$      | `Derivative(T(x,t),t)`  | `dT/dt`                     |
| $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}x}$      | `Derivative(T(x,t),x)`  | `dT/dx`                     |
| $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 T}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$ | `Derivative(T(x,t),x,x)`| `(d^2T)/(dx^2),  d^2T/dx^2` |

Suggestions of correct responses to try:

`Derivative(T(x,t),x,x) + Derivative(q(x,t),t)/k = 1/alpha*Derivative(T(x,t),t)`

`alpha*k*(d^2T)/(dx^2) = k*(dT/dt) - alpha*q_dot`

`d^2T/dx^2 + q_dot/k = 1/alpha*(dT/dt)`

`(d^2T)/(dx^2) + q_dot/k = 1/alpha*(dT/dt)`

A simple example of an incorrect expression:

`k*alpha*(d^2T)/(dx^2) = k*(dT/dt) + alpha*q_dot`

Note that omitting the arguments of functions (when not using an alias) can cause errors.

Compare what happens with response

`Derivative(T(x,t),x,x) + Derivative(q(x,t),t)/k = 1/alpha*Derivative(T(x,t),t)`

and

`Derivative(T,x,x) + Derivative(q,t)/k = 1/alpha*Derivative(T,t)`

#### Syntactical comparison

Typically `compareExpressions` only checks if the response is mathematically equivalent to the answer. If we want to require that the answer is written in a certain way, e.g. Cartesian form vs. exponential form of a complex number or standard form vs factorized form of a polynomial, further comparisons need to be done. There are some built in standard forms that can be detected, as well as a method that tries to match the way that the response is written in a limited fashion. Either method can be activated either by setting the flag `syntactical_comparison` to `true`, or by using the criteria `response written as answer`.

##### Standard forms for complex numbers

For complex numbers there are two known forms, Cartesian form, $a+bi$, and exponential form, $ae^{bi}$.

For either form the pattern detection only works if $a$ and $b$ are written as numbers on decimal form, i.e. no fractions or other mathematical expressions.

The example set has two response areas, one with an answer written in Cartesian form ($2+2i$) and one with the answer written in exponential form ($2e^{2i}$). For both response areas the parameter `complexNumbers` is set to `true` (so that `I` will be treated as the imaginary constant) and `syntactical_comparison` is set to `true` (to activate the syntactical comparison). There is also an input symbol that makes `I`, `i` and `j` all be interpreted as the imaginary constant $i$. The evaluation function automatically detects the form of the answer and uses it as the basis of the comparison.

##### Arbitrary syntactical comparison by comparing the form of the response to the form of the answer

The criteria keyword `written as` can be used for more general syntactical comparison, see *Examples: Customizing comparisons using criteria: Using `written as` to syntactical comparison* for details.

#### Custom feedback based on response evaluation results

For incorrect responses the feedback generated by the evaluation function can be replaced. Either the same feedback can be shown for any incorrect answer or the feedback generated for specific properties for the given response.

To give custom feedback for any incorrect response, set the parameter `feedback_for_incorrect_response` to the desired feedback string.

For the response area below `feedback_for_incorrect_response` is set to "This message will be displayed for any incorrect response." and the answer is $x$.

Some more feedback customisation is shown in *Examples: Customizing comparison using criteria: Customising feedback based on satisfied criteria*.

#### Using integrals

The evaluation function can handle one-dimensional definite integrals, i.e. expression in the form $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x$, if the `elementary_functions` parameter is set to true. The integrand and the boundary values can be symbolic.

**Note:** Indefinite integrals (expression in the form $\int f(x) \mathrm{d}x$), contour integrals ($\oint f(x) \mathrm{d}x$) and integrals based on abstract measures ($\int_A f(x) \mathrm{d}\mu$) are not supported.

The expression $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x$ can be written `Integral(f(x), (x, a, b))`. The syntax works as follows: the integral sign corresponds to `Integral` (the short form `int` can also be used), which must be followed by two argument, first is the integrand (the function that is integrated), the second is a triple containing; the variable to be integrated over and the two boundary values.

Here is an example of an integral that can be fully evaluated, more specifically $\int_0^2 3xy \mathrm{d}x = 6y$. If the answer is set to `Integral(3xy, (x, 0, 2))` then response area will accept both integral expressions, e.g. `int(3*y*x, (x, 0, 2))`, and computed expressions, e.g. `6y`.

The boundary and function does not need to be defined explicitly. As an example of a more abstract integral we can consider $\int_a^b f(x)+g(x) \mathrm{d}x$. If the answer is set to `Integral(f(x)+g(x), (x, a, b))` then, for example, `int(g(x)+f(x), (x, a, b))` $\int_a^b g(x)+f(x) \mathrm{d}x$ and `int(f(x), (x, a, b)) + int(g(x), (x, a, b))` $\int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x+\int_a^b g(x) \mathrm{d}x$.

## Working with Reserved Characters

SymPy recommends that you not use I, E, S, N, C, O, or Q for variable or symbol names, as those are used for the imaginary unit ($i$), the base of the natural logarithm ($e$), the sympify function (`S()`), numeric evaluation (`N()`), the big O order symbol (as in $O(n)$), and the assumptions object that holds a list of supported ask keys (such as `Q.real`), respectively. You can use the mnemonic OSINEQ to remember what Symbols are defined by default in SymPy. Or better yet, always use lowercase letters for Symbol names. Python will not prevent you from overriding default SymPy names or functions, so be careful."

If you want to use a symbol that is usually reserved for some reserved character, e.g. ‘E’, do as follows:
1. Create an input symbol where the code is different that the symbol you want to use, e.g. ‘Ef’ or 'Euler' instead of ‘E’
2. Add the symbol you want to use as an alternative, e.g. the alternatives could be set to ‘E’

#### Example:
For the answer:
$A/(E*l)$, $E$ is reserved, so we replace $E$ with $ef$ and provide alternatives as input symbols:

Symbol: $ϵ$

Code: `ef`

Alternatives: `ϵ,ε,E,e,Ep`

Here the answer $A/(E*l)$ is marked as correct.


### Reserved Characters and Implicit Multiplication
As implicit multiplication cannot decypher what is a multi-character code and what are two variables that should be multiplied, single letter codes should be used.

#### Example
With `"convention": "implicit_higher_precedence"` set

For the answer:
$A/(E*l)$ $E$ is reserved, so we replace $E$ with $b$ and provide alternatives as input symbols:
Symbol: ϵ
Code: b
Alternatives: ϵ,ε,E,e,Ep

Here the answer A/El is marked as correct.

### Overriding greek letters or other reserved symbols with input symbols

Sometimes there can be ambiguities in the expected responses. For example `xi` in a response could either be interpreted as the greek letter $\xi$ or as the multiplication $x \cdot i$.

If there is an ambiguity the parser will choose the longest corresponding string, in the example above that means that `xi` will be interpreted as $\xi$ rather than $x \cdot i$.

This behaviour can in many cases be overridden using input symbols, by letting the meaning with the longer corresponding string be an alternative to the interpretation consisting of several shorter strings. In the above example adding an input symbol with code `x\*i` and alternative `xi` will ensure that `xi` will be interpreted as  $x \cdot i$ rather than $\xi$.

In this example the answer is set to $5 x \mathbf{i}-12 y \mathbf{j}$, while `strict_syntax` is set to false and `elementary_functions` is set to true.

In order for the response `5xi-12yj` to be interpreted as $5 x \mathbf{i}-12 y \mathbf{j}$ instead of $5 \xi-12 y \mathbf{j}$ the following input symbols have been added:

| Symbol              | Code | Alternatives |
|:--------------------|:-----|:-------------|
| `\$x\$`             | x    |              |
| `\$\\mathbf{i}\$`   | i    |              |
| `\$x \\mathbf{i}\$` | x\*i | xi           |
| `\$y\$`             | y    |              |
| `\$\\mathbf{j}\$`   | j    |              |
