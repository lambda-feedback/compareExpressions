# Compare Expressions

This function utilises the SymPy to provide a maths-aware comparison of a student's response to the correct answer. This means that mathematically equivalent inputs will be marked as correct. Note that pi is a reserved constant and cannot be used as a symbol name.

For more information look at the docs [here](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/user_eval_function_docs/compareExpressions/) or in `docs/`.
